 * SquadsView is a page-level component that internally manages three drill-down levels:
 * 1. Squad grid (organogram)
 * 2. Squad detail with tabs (overview, org chart, connections)
 * 3. Agent detail
 *
 * It uses hooks (useSquads, useAgents, useSquadStats, useAgent) and falls back to
 * placeholder data when the API returns empty. This means it renders meaningfully
 * even without a running backend.
